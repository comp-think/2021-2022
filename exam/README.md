  4. The merge sort is an algorithm using a divide a conquer approach for addressing the computational problem sorting all the items in a given list. The steps composing the algorithm can be summarised as follows:
  
  * [base case] if the input list has only one item, return the list as it is; otherwise,
  * [divide] split the input list into two balanced halves, i.e. containing almost the same number of items each;
  * [conquer] run the merge sort algorithm recursively on each of the halves obtained in the previous step;
  * [combine] merge the two ordered lists returned by the last step by using the algorithm merge and return the result.

  The last step uses an ancillary algorithm , called merge, that is responsible for combining two ordered input lists to return a new list that contains all the elements in the input lists ordered.
