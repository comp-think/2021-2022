					<h2>Your take</h2>
					<p><a href="https://jamboard.google.com/d/19ifAsZZA5qP-olIPpk7U3CwYtD1yLXqE2yogPvuhlVU/edit?usp=sharing">Describe</a> in one word what you think this course is about</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>About the course</h2>
					<p><strong>Goal:</strong> how to use a language to communicate with and instruct an information-processing agent</p>
					<p class="fragment"><strong>Computer Science notions:</strong> algorithms, data structures, and algorithmic techniques</p>
					<p class="fragment"><strong>Language for communication:</strong> Python (yes, it is a programming language)</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Rumors</h2>
					<p>Some whispers of despair:</p>
					<p class="fragment st"><q>algorithms, computations, programming, etc., are something which I cannot handle – indeed, I did not like mathematics at the high school</q></p>
					<p class="fragment st"><q>I am not able to abstract a situation by using formal tools since I am not a formal person</q></p>
					<p class="fragment st"><q>I cannot learn a programming language</q></p>
					<p class="fragment">These are just <strong>prejudices</strong></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Yes, we can</h2>
					<p class="st">Several of the things the book introduces are something that all of us <strong>already learned and digested</strong> during our life - it is only a matter of identifying them again to reuse them consciously</p>
					<p class="fragment st">Intelligence is a muscle, it <strong>can be developed</strong> - we can learn anything, including Computer Science topics, despite what others say<br /><small>More info in: <cite>Dweck, C. (2006). Mindset: The New Psychology of Success. Random USA. ISBN: 978-0345472328</cite></small></p>
					<p class="fragment st">A programming language is a language, such as Italian and English - we need <strong>time and practice</strong> to learn it properly</p>
					<p class="fragment">Suggested mindset: be an <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html">hacker</a><br/><small><q>one who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations</q></small></p>

				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Communications</h2>
					<p>We use a Signal group for communicating with each other</p>
                    <p><a href="https://signal.org">Signal</a> is a cloud-based mobile and desktop messaging app with a focus on security and speed, it is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open source software</a>, and can be used in any device (it has been developed for mobile and desktop devices)</p>
                    <p>Invitation link to join the group: <br /><a href="https://signal.group/#CjQKICS9Jct3jXhbC2MvbfZ8NWbdDes1cCdcg-ylMGTLBzeEEhBHzCfdCxp6djhSHHrErD2k">https://signal.group/#CjQKICS9Jct3jXhbC2MvbfZ8NWbdDes1cCdcg-ylMGTLBzeEEhBHzCfdCxp6djhSHHrErD2k</a></p>
					<p>Note: I need to approve each request by hand</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Twitter</h2>
					<p>The course has its own Twitter account: <a href="https://twitter.com/UniboCompThink">@UniboCompThink</a></p>
                    <p>Twitter will be used to highlight interesting articles and initiatives about computational thinking, and to share the various topics addressed during the course so as to provide the materials to anyone can be interested</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Interacting</h2>
					<p>We will use the <a href="https://github.com/comp-think/2021-2022/">GitHub repository of the course</a> for a series of activities, such as exercises and raising issues</p>
					<p>Thus, please, create a new account on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/join">https://github.com/join</a></p>
					<p>Once logged into GitHub, go to the <a href="https://github.com/comp-think/2021-2022/issues">issue page</a> of the course repository, and then feel free to add and respond to issues there</p>
					<p>A very introductory guide to GitHub can be find <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/120U_qFLpHMWrC7BQE55pNZbU8lPqa_NDUoNFEpvF67Y/edit#slide=id.p">online</a></p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Course organisation</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Theoretical part (30 hours), where I will introduce all the notions related to the course - no computer needed: 15 lectures of two hours each (today included)</p>
					<p class="fragment">Practical sessions, where <a href="https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/bruno.sartini3/en">Bruno Sartini</a> will be available for helping you in the issues that may arise during the course (e.g. solving exercises) - use Signal for coordination (e.g. topic to address and when)</p>
					<p class="fragment">Laboratorial part (12 hours), where <a href="https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/ivan.heibi2/en">Ivan Heibi</a> will have some practical lectures on programming languages - computer needed here</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Theory, practice, laboratory</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Theory: it introduces the tools for doing something - e.g. vocabulary and syntax of a language</p>
					<p class="fragment">Practice: it addresses assignments to enable people to learn and understand the correct way to use such tools - e.g. using the language vocabulary and syntax to write sentences to express a particular idea or situation</p>
					<p class="fragment">Laboratory: a workshop run by someone that enables one to use the tools learned to understand advanced concepts and to build wonderful (and complex) artifacts - e.g. writing a novel</p>

					<h2>Exam</h2>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment"><p>A non-mandatory workshop (immediately after the last lecture, e.g. 21 December), where the students are asked to organise themself in groups of 3-4 people (max. score: 4)</p></li>
						<li class="fragment">
							<p>A final written examination (max. score: 32) - when:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>28 January 2022</li>
								<li>14 March 2022</li>
								<li>16 May 2022</li>
								<li>20 June 2022</li>
								<li>11 July 2022</li>
								<li>5 September 2022</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="fragment">Total max. score: 36 (32 without the workshop) out of 30</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Registering final grade</h2>
					<p>As you know, this course is just a module of an Integrated Course (I. C.)</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Computational Management of Data (Integrated Course)</p>
							<ul>
								<li><p>Module 1: <span class="cr">Computational Thinking and Programming</span> (this course!)</p></li>
								<li><p>Module 2: Data Science (second semester course, taught by me)</p></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>You can register only the final grade of the Integrated Course, which is computed as the average of the final scores of the two modules (max. 30L each module)</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Evaluation of the course</h2>
					<p>Usually, during one of the last lectures of the course, you will be asked to fill-up a questionnaire on the organisation of the course and related stuff - it is anonymous, of course</p>
					<p>Please, do it carefully and honestly, since it is one of the most important inputs I will have to understand what can be improved in the next year course</p>
					<p>The fact that the course of this year is slightly different from the one held during the previous year one is mainly due to the comments I have received through these questionnaires</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>About learning a new language</h2>
					<p><img src="img/japanese.png" /></p>
					<p class="fragment">Do you think that attending only to all the classes of a 6 credit course (i.e. 30 hours) on a foreign language is enough to master its basics?</p>
					<p class="fragment">Learning a programming language is like learning a new language: you need to practice it (a lot) to master it properly</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Final recommendations (1)</h2>
					<p class="sst tr wmm fr">Umberto Eco (1980). The Name of the Rose. <a href="http://www.goodwin.ee/ekafoto/tekstid/Eco%20Umberto%20-%20The%20Name%20Of%20The%20Rose.pdf">Available online</a></p>
					<blockquote class="wmm fl st"><p>In the face of some inexplicable facts you must try to imagine many general laws, whose connection with your facts escapes you. Then suddenly [...] you perceive a line of reasoning that seems more convincing than the others. You try applying it to all similar cases [...] and you discover that your intuition was right.</p></blockquote>
					<p class="fragment fr wmm">There is no single solution to a given problem, and the best one can be found only trying (and making mistakes, and trying again and again) more than one approach</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Final recommendations (2)</h2>
					<p class="sst tr wm fr">Stephen Toulmin (1958). The Uses of Arguments. <a href="http://johnnywalters.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/3/5/13358288/toulmin-the-uses-of-argument_1.pdf">Available online</a></p>
					<blockquote class="wl fl st"><p>The purpose of these studies is to raise problems, not to solve them</p></blockquote>
					<p class="fragment">Please do ask questions</p>
					<p class="fragment">There are no stupid questions</p>
					<p class="fragment">My answers can be odd though, sometime</p>
					<p class="fragment">Thus, in order to avoid such odd answers, I could ask you to be patient and wait for the next lecture, so as to provide you with the best possible answer ever</p>

					<h2>About <q>thinking</q></h2>
					<p>Computational <span class="fragment highlight-red">Thinking</span> and Programming</p>
					<p class="fragment">Understanding <span class="cr">how</span> your thinking mechanisms work and training you in been flexible and reactive while thinking can be achieved only by <span class="cr">thinking about something</span></p>
					<p class="fragment">Thus, let us do a couple of experiments!</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Experiment 1</h2>
					<p class="fr wm"><img src="img/three-glasses.png" /></p>
					<p>Material:</p>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li><p>3 glasses</p></li>
						<li><p>4 knives</p></li>
						<li><p>1 book</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p class="fragment">Setting:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment"><p>the glasses as vertexes of a triangle of equal sides</p></li>
						<li class="fragment"><p>the base of each glass is separated from the other by the lenght of a knife</p></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Goal of experiment 1</h2>
					<p>Using the knives, creating a platform on top of the glasses</p>
					<p>The knives used must not touch the ground</p>
					<p>The platform must support the weight of the book</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What we learned from experiment 1</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Approaching the solution may be difficult if there is no pattern provided by experience</p>
					<p class="fragment">It is important to analyse the situation to see if all the material available is useful, leaving out everything does not really help</p>
					<p class="fragment">Trial-and-error prodedure may be effective</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Experiment 2</h2>
					<p class="fr wm"><img src="img/four-glasses.png" /></p>
					<p>Material:</p>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li><p>4 glasses</p></li>
						<li><p>4 knives</p></li>
						<li><p>1 book</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p class="fragment">Setting:</p>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li><p>the glasses at a corner of a square</p></li>
						<li><p>the base of each glass is separated from the other by the lenght of a knife</p></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Goal of experiment 2</h2>
					<p>Using the knives, creating a platform on top of the glasses</p>
					<p>The knives used must not touch the ground</p>
					<p>The platform must support the weight of the book</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What we learned from experiment 2</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Recognising essential similarity of a problem to one already solved makes the problem easier to solve</p>
					<p class="fragment">Experience is much more valuable if some general principle is derived from it</p>
					<p class="fragment">Use of patterns provided by experience is the most rapid way of solving problems</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>The general principle</h2>
					<p>Can you devise a general principle that can be use to solve both the situations introduced in the previous experiment?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Closing</h2>
					<p>These kinds of thinking exercises you performed today will characterise the entire course</p>
					<p>Concepts such as <span class="cr">abstraction</span>, <span class="cr">trial-and-error</span> learning, <span class="cr">prior experience</span>, deriving <span class="cr">general principles</span>, <span class="cr">practice</span>, are key factors when learning a new language (including a new programming language)</p> 
					<p>Note: the two thinking experiments with glasses and knives introduced in this opening lecture come from the book <cite>The 5-Day Course in Thinking</cite> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_de_Bono">Edward de Bono</a>.</p>
